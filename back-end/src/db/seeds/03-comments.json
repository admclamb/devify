    "comment": "Search then move is definitely better overall ‚Äî‚Äî especially in a pretty uncertain time right now.\n\nThere is some nuance here. When I made the only major move of my life, I got in touch with a recruiter ahead of time who could help set me up with opportunities and then got my foot in the door in the local job market. I wound up moving before getting things fully wrapped up, but I had a really solid expectation of how things were ultimately going to shake up by then, and I wound up taking a job I hadn't yet applied for before moving.\n\nStill, best case scenario is something lined up, but there might be some sensible middle-ground worth considering."

    "comment": "If you can search before moving do that (safer money-wise and less stress I guess), otherwise: if you're mentally super down in your current place, prioritise the leave and the search afterwards.\n\nIf you want just a fresh start in a new place and if you're in your 20's, #YOLO!ü§òüèΩ"

    "comment": "I've always searched then moved. There are 2 reasonsbehind this:\n1 - it gives you freedom to search anywhere so you can really see the playing field as a whole\n2 - location and therefore relocation packages can be negotiated with any decent company.\n\nSince the pandemic gave rise to the remote worker I would also argue it has now made a 3rd reason more promenent:\n\n3 - you may find an awesome remote job and then you've got the new position and still the freedom to find a new location you would like to live in"
